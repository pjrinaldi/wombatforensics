/**
* FXRex is a regular expression class implementing a NFA matcher.
* It supports capturing parentheses, non-capturing parentheses, positive or negative
* lookahead, backreferences, case-insensitive matching, counted repetitions, greedy, lazy and
* possessive matches, and PERL-like matching operators.
* The subject string may be searched forwards or backwards, and may contain any of
* 256 possible byte values.
*
* When parsing a regular expression pattern, the mode parameter is the bitwise OR of
* a set of flags and affects the match algorithm.  Passing the flag Capture enables
* capturing parentheses and back references, and allows the matcher engine to return
* the locations of the string matching these sub-patterns. The flag IgnoreCase enables
* case-insensitive matching.
*
* When the flag Newline is passed, newlines are treated like normal characters, and
* not line-separators.  If Newline flag is not passed, character classes such as '.',
* '\D', '\s', [^a-z] etc. will NOT match newlines.  The flag Verbatim disables all
* special character interpretation, making the entire pattern a literal string to be
* matched against a string.
*
* When the Exact flag is passed, a match succeeds only if the entire string is matched,
* i.e. the entire input presented to FXRex must match against the pattern; otherwise,
* only a (possibly empty) substring of the input is matched against the pattern.
* If the NotEmpty flag is passed, the pattern must match at least one character in order
* to succeed, and empty matches are considered non-matching.
*
* If the flag Syntax will check the pattern for correct syntax only, and not generate a
* matching engine; it will just reset the engine to the empty pattern; use this flag to
* verify the syntax of the pattern without compiling it.
*
* When matching a compiled pattern, the mode parameter is the bitwise OR of a set of
* flags that affects how the match is performed.  Passing the flags NotBol and/or NotEol
* causes the begin and end of the subject string NOT to be considered a line start or
* line end.
*
* Patterns which cause inordinate amounts of recursion may cause FXRex to fail where
* otherwise it would succeed to match.
* FXRex uses no global variables, and thus multiple threads may simultaneously use it;
* moreover, multiple threads may use the same instance to perform a match.
