/**
* An Image is a rectangular array of pixels.  It supports two representations
* of these pixels: a client-side pixel buffer which is stored as an array of
* FXColor, and a server-side pixmap which is stored in an organization directly
* compatible with the screen, for fast drawing onto the device.
* The server-side representation is not directly accessible from the current
* process as it lives in the process of the X Server or GDI.
* Before the image can be used in drawing operations, the server-side representation
* of the image must be realized by calling create(); until this is done, only the
* client-side pixel buffer exists.
* Usually the client-side pixel buffer is released when the server-side representation
* is generated [thus saving substantial amounts of memory when only the server-resident
* part of the image is of interest].  But if further manipulation of the client-side
* pixel buffer is needed, the IMAGE_KEEP option can be passed.  In that case, the
* client-side buffer can be modified, and the server-side pixmap can be updated by
* calling render().
