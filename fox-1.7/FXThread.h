/**
* FXThread provides system-independent support for threads.
*
* Subclasses of FXThread must implement the run() function to implement
* the desired functionality of the thread object.  The thread can be
* started by calling start(), passing an optional size to allocate for
* the thread's stack space.
* Each thread can have thread-local storage.  FXThread has at least one
* thread-local variable, a pointer to the FXThread object itself; this
* value can be obtained at any time during the execution of the thread by
* calling self().  The value of self() is automatically set when the thread
* is started.
* Additional thread-local variables may be obtained using FXAutoThreadStorageKey.
* Initially, all signals are masked by newly started threads (only the main thread
* will normally handle signals).
* To reclaim the resources once the thread is completed, a call to join() must be
* made, or the thread must be detached (note however that detaching the thread will
* sever the association between FXThread and the thread).
* The special FXThreadException may be used to terminate a thread gracefully,
* and pass a return code to the corresponding join() operation.  This is preferred
* over the raw FXThread::exit().
* Unknown exceptions cause the program to terminate with an error.
* Calling the destructor from within the thread itself (suicide) is allowed; the
* thread will be detached and terminate immediately.
* Calling the destructor from another thread will cancel() the thread if it is
* still running.  Due to the asynchronous nature of threads, it is usually not a
* good idea to do this; it is recommended that subclasses call join(), and delay
* the execution of the destructor until the thread has completed normally.
